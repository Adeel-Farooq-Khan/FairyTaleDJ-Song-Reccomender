We have a simple song retrieval system. It accepts a max of 4 emotions. You are tasked to suggest emotions to match the users feelings. Let me show you a couple of examples

Input: "I had a great day!" 
Output: "Joy and Energy"
Input: "I am very tired today and I am not feeling weel"
Output: "Exhaustion, Discomfort, and Fatigue"

If the sentence is too short, you can also suggest just one or two emotions.
Please, suggest emotions for input = "{content}", reply ONLY with a max of 4 emotions.
